# In Remembrance

Britten wrote a dedication to four of his friends who had died in the war in the opening page of his score for
the War Requiem. Just as he wished to remember those who had fallen, we are offering a ‘Poppy Wall’ where we extend
an invitation to all participants to dedicate their attendance at the concert to anyone of any nationality adversely
affected by any war by adding a personal message to the wall.  

You may wish to remember someone you have lost and about what their loss means to you.
If you wish, you may like to add any details of their regiment and where they fought.
You might wish to remember someone who survived a conflict but who may not be otherwise remembered.
Our Poppy Wall is open to anyone. 

The ‘Poppy Slips’ will be added to the ‘Wall’ and displayed, firstly in Basingstoke Library, from Monday 21 May,
and then at The Anvil in readiness for our concert on 9 June.

[Here is a slip that you can print off](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VbGIl6VCaAYpo7cZ_p-PA05CEGXaTASo) and make your dedication prior to the concert,
we hope that you will attend the concert to see your slip displayed on the wall and to enjoy Britten’s Requiem,
where the Latin Mass text of a traditional requiem is woven together with the devastating war poetry of
Wilfred Owen to produce a powerful denunciation of the wickedness of war and a warning to future generations
of the senselessness of taking up arms against one’s fellow man.
