# In Remembrance
In the opening page of his score for the War Requiem, Britten wrote a dedication to four of his friends who had died
in the war. Just as he wished to remember those who had fallen, we are offering a ‘Poppy Wall’,
where we extend an invitation to all participants fill out a ‘Poppy Slip’ to dedicate their attendance
at the concert to anyone of any nationality adversely affected by any war.

You might wish to remember someone you have lost, and what that loss means to you, with a simple name and date.

Or you might want to add details of their regiment and where they fought. Equally, you might wish to remember
someone who survived a conflict but who would not be otherwise remembered. Our Poppy Wall is open to anyone.

The ‘Poppy Slips’ will be added to the ‘Wall’ and displayed, firstly in Basingstoke Library, from Monday 21 May,
and then at The Anvil in readiness for our concert on 9 June.

Slips will be available at The Anvil on the night of the concert, but if you would like to prepare your dedication
in advance,
[you can print off your own poppy slip (clip here)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VbGIl6VCaAYpo7cZ_p-PA05CEGXaTASo)
at home.

On arrival at the concert, please take your slip to the Poppy Wall.
