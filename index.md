A lifelong pacifist, Benjamin Britten was asked to compose the War Requiem
for the consecration of the rebuilt Coventry Cathedral after its destruction in
World War II.

The work weaves together the Latin Mass text of a traditional requiem with
the devastating war poetry of Wilfred Owen to produce a powerful
denunciation of the wickedness of war and a warning to future generations of
the senselessness of taking up arms against oneâ€™s fellow man. 2018 marks the
centenary of the end of World War I, and given its subject matter, this timeless
message of peace gives us all the opportunity to acknowledge all those who
made the ultimate sacrifice.

[Basingstoke Choral Society](http://baschoral.wixsite.com/bcsoc), [Southampton Philharmonic Choir](http://www.southamptonphil.org/web/), the
[Southampton University Philharmonic Choir](https://www.susu.org/groups/suphil) and the [City of Southampton
Orchestra](https://www.csorchestra.org/) combine their considerable forces for this unique performance.
