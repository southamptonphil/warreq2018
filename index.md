**My subject is War, and the pity of War.**

**The Poetry is in the pity...**

**All a poet can do today is warn.**

Benjamin Britten included these words by Wilfred Owen on the title page of his War Requiem. The work, an expression of his
pacifism, was first performed during the Coventry Festival in 1962, in the rebuilt and newly consecrated Coventry Cathedral.
The old cathedral had been virtually destroyed during the Blitz and, after the war, was rebuilt to a new design, in a spirit
of reconciliation after conflict.

The work weaves together the Latin Mass text of a traditional requiem with
the devastating war poetry of Wilfred Owen to produce a powerful
denunciation of the wickedness of war and a warning to future generations of
the senselessness of taking up arms against one’s fellow man. 2018 marks the
centenary of the end of World War I, and given its subject matter, this timeless
message of peace gives us all the opportunity to acknowledge all those who
made the ultimate sacrifice.
